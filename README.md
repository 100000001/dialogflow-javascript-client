# Development

* Checkout from this repository, do not forget to switch to "v2" branch
* run `$ npm install`
* run `$ typings install`
* run `$ webpack -w`
* develop! (webpack will automatically compile SDK to ./target/ApiAi.js file on each change, just include it into some test HTML file (./demo/index.html will probably do the job) and test it).

### Notice

Command `$ webpack` compiles ./target/ApiAi.js file that can be used in browser.

Command `$ webpack --minify` or `$ webpack -m` compiles ./target/ApiAi.min.js file

# Usage
